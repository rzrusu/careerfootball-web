# Introducing the Mail System

### Inbox Categories
Your mail will be automatically organized into different categories:

- Transfer Offers
- Staff Communications
  - Coach Reports
  - Scout Findings
- Media Interactions
- Board Messages

### Message Priority System

Messages will be marked with different priority levels:

1. ***Urgent*** - Requires immediate attention
2. **Important** - Should be addressed soon
3. *Regular* - Standard communications

Here's an example of how priority flags appear in your inbox: `[URGENT] Transfer Deadline Approaching`

> **Pro Tip:** You can customize notification settings for each priority level to ensure you never miss critical messages.

### Technical Implementation

The mail system uses a sophisticated algorithm to:
- Filter spam messages
- Prioritize communications
- Generate contextual responses
